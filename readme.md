Making a Invoice Management System

Project Description -
A given invoice managing website was given where invoices added by the user can be updated, deleted or created depending on the user. Invoice contained information about 
sender's name, address, email | receiver's name, address, email | Item information

The whole state of the web app was managed using redux store. The state changes during editing the invoice, deleting the invoice or updating it were maintained sophistically using redux store rather than usual component states.

Task - 
Originally, it only had a option to edit the invoice individually by clicking the edit button.
So, the task was to upgrade the invoice management system by adding a bulk edit feature for the users. So that the user can select multiple invoice records at a time and edit them together.

Steps to install the project - 
1. Clone the github repository using --git clone or just download the zip file
2. Go inside the folder where project is downloaded. run npm install command to install all the dependencies.
3. run npm start to run the project on localhost:3000
